  Host Bot is an XMPP bot meant to be run on a host. The bot is easy to
  extend if you know some ruby. There are many ulling working example
  commands as part of the base bot. Adding your own commands can be done
  by pattern matching an existing command to create your own. The basic
  commands are generally commands that can be run on may different hosts
  at the same time and then compared to know something about the state
  of a system. For a detailed description of commands look into the file
  named "doc/COMMANDS"

  You need the xmpp4r module installed before hostbot will run. xmpp4r is
  is also free and maintained. Once done you can usually just do the usual

  # ruby setup.rb

  OR

  % ruby setup.rb all --prefix=$HOME

  A script must be used to invoke the hostbot module and good example
  scripts are installed by default named configbot.rb and muppetbot.rb.
  Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own functionality and
  realize that many of muppetbot.rb's features are specific to being a
  master puppet bot. See also "docs/BOTS" for more info

  Many other bots were born, raised and eventually slaughtered in the making
  of this bot. This code base is meant to be stable and simple to extend
  while still being powerful enough to accomplish complicated things. I
  expect a few changes as people say, "why in the world did you X instead of
  Y" and I can't give a good reason to stay with X or at least not go to Y.

  Tim Spriggs started writing the code and got the idea prototyped and
  proven across many systems. As the bot grew and certain ideas were
  explored, Kenny Fine started to collaborate and develop code and as
  ideas and code started bouncing back and forth the design went through
  some very good but large changes to where it is now. Of course a huge
  round of thanks goes to the HiRISE System's group in general and the
  HiRISE project without whom this bot would not exist.
